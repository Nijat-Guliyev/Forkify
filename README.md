# Project Title

**Forkify**

## Introduction

**Forkify** is an application designed for ordering meals. This project was created as a personal exercise to improve my skills. Forkify simplifies meal management with easy bookmarking and portion adjustments.

## Features

- **Search Functionality:** Click the Search button to find recipes or navigate to the Add Recipe section to upload your own.
- **Bookmark Icon:** Recipes are automatically saved to the bookmark icon at the top-right corner.
- **Ingredient Error Handling:** Displays an error message for incorrect or unnecessary input (_e.g., random names like qwerty or weird entries_).
- **Servings Adjustment:** Use the minus and plus buttons to modify the portion sizes or number of servings.
- **Hover Effects:** Includes visually appealing hover effects with color transitions and smooth animations for an enhanced user experience.

## Usage

1. **Search Recipes:** Use the Search button and type ingredient names like _pizza, avocado, or salad._
2. **Add Recipes:** Navigate to the Add Recipe button, fill in the necessary fields (_e.g., image URL, ingredients_), and click the Upload button.
3. **View Saved Recipes:** Hover over the bookmark icon to view saved recipes.
4. **Handle Errors:** Ensure valid input to avoid error messages.
5. **Adjust Servings:** Customize servings using the minus and plus buttons.

## Responsive Design

This application focuses primarily on JavaScript functionality and features. While advanced responsiveness is not the focus of this project, other projects demonstrate my proficiency in responsive design.

- **1200px (Large Desktops)**
- **980px (Desktops/Laptops)**

_Note: Proper layout may not be guaranteed for screens smaller than 980px due to the project's focus on functionality over responsive design._
